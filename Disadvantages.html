<p>The spiral model can be a very costly model to use. Because each project requires a customized version of it, there is no easy answer to "how many spirals will this project require?" A skilled or experienced project manager might be able to accurately guess how many iterations could be required, but adding or changing the project's requirements (while perfectly acceptable) could dramatically change the project's timeline since a full turn through the spiral's phases is required. Because of this, the end of the project may be hard to estimate early on.</p>
<p>Each additional spiral increases the total cost of the project, as seen in the image below.</p>

<p>The process of completing a project can be very complex and requires a certain amount of risk-analysis expertise for success. The model places a large relianace on the ability of software developers to identify and manage sources of project risk. If an inexperienced team fails to elaborate on the high-risk elements involved in their project, they will be under the illusion that the project is making progress while in reality it will beheading towards failure. This risk-driven benefit of the spiral model also means it is very people-dependent to keep projects from going astray.</p>
<p>This dependency also means that those risk-analysis experts will be forced to spend a large amount of time digging through the project's details to identify risks during each spiral. These same experts will also have their time claimed by the documenting and reviewing of documentation required by risk-analysis.
