<p>The spiral lifecycle is a very effective model, however it is not the answer to solving all development woes. It is complex and requires a great deal of analysis and expertise. The amount of processes that goes into each spiral means that it may not be suitable for small projects.</p>
<p>However, being such a highly-adaptable model means that it can be adapted to a wide range of software project situations. It solves the difficulties associated with other models of development while incorporating their strengths.</p>
<p>The spiral model also relies heavily on being implemented by experienced personnel. It is not a lifecycle model to be taken likely and if the manager in charge is adequately experienced or trained in the process of risk analysis, then this model will fail despite its many strengths.</p> 
<p>This spiral model is a very good model for medium- to -large projects where risk avoidance is especially important. It is also a good approach is users are initially unsure of their needs or if those needs can be very complex. This model also handles changes well, so if a product is started where its requirements are expected to be modified at a later date, this model would serve well.</p>
