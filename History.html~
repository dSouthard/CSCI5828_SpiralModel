<blockquote>Stop the life cycle -- I want to get off!</blockquote>

	<p>The spiral model was first defined by Barry Boehm in an August 1986 article, "A Spiral Model of Software Developments and Enhancement," following that article up with a published paper of the same name in the May 1988 IEEE Computer journal.</p>
<p>His papers introduced the diagram which is still used today to describe this particular lifecyle: </p>
      <img src="res/BoehmSpiralModel.jpg" alt="Boehm's Spiral Model">
      <p>Boehm termed his model a "process model generator" to highlight the fact that it compromises other models of software developement, depending on the choices made by the developing team. For instance, a team that decides to base their development on the waterfall method could be seen as using the spiral method, traveling around the spiral once only. In this way, the spiral model can be adapted to generate a specific process appropriate for a specific project. </p>
      <p>The design places emphasis on iterative development through a <i>risk-driven</i> approach rather than <i>document-driven</i> or <i>code-driven</i>. Boehm proposed the model in order to incoporate the strengths of other models at the time while simultanously resolving their difficulties. In his paper, Boehm summarized those strengths and weaknesses. </p>
      <p>The code-and-fix model, used in the earliest days of software development, had the extreme problem of resulting in code so poorly structured that subsequent fixes were very expensive, highlighting the need for a design phase prior to coding. </p>
      <img src="res/waterfall-model.jpg" alt="Waterfall Model">
      <p>The waterfall model improved upon that method by stipulating that software had to be developed in successive stages with design occuring prior to actual coding. An enhanced waterfall model added feedback loops between those successive stages. However, the waterfall model still had a document-driven standard, emphasizing fully elaborated documents as completion criteria for early requirement and design phases. This results in many projects being pushed to write poorly developed documentation, which in turn results in the developement of large quantities of unuseable code.</p>
      <img src="res/iterative-model.jpg" alt="Iterative Model">
      <p>The iterative development model consists of stages of expanding increments of an operational product. It fits the situation where a user can say "I can't tell you want I want, but I'll know it when I see it," allowing for developers to provide rapid initial operational capability and giving them a feedback loop for determing subsequent product improvements. This model has some of the same problems of the code-and-fix model, where if previous code was not modulized enough it resulted in large swatchs of useless code as areas of product improvement were determined.</p>
      <p>The spiral model proposes to fix these problems and more. Software developement is to take place through a series of cycles through the model's four phases. The underlying concept is that each cycle involves a progression through the same sequence of steps for each portion of the code.</p>
